# The-Sentinel-VR
This is a port of the 8-bits classic videogame "The Sentinel", but in Virtual reality using Android and Google Cardboard or similar VR glasses
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_(video_game)

The project pretends to be as respectfull as possible to the original one, but adding the VR experience.

in order to play, an Android device and VR glasses are required (Google CardBoard or similar). Also, a gamePad, VR control, or keyboard is 
needed to be connected to the Android device.
The game only needs four controls, so I suggets the use of the arrow keys.

The signed Android APK is provided in the "build" folder.
When launched, you have to first touch the "setup" button in order to config the keys, and calibrate the screen.
After that you can touch the play button and start playing with the VR glasses.

The code has benn made in Processing

using android mode
